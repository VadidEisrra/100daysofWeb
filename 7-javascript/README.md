# JavaScript

So, this began as an introduction to JS and my notes for the exercises can be found in `notes` and the exercises (simple calculator) in the `exercises` folder.

THEN

I recalled my frontend mentor css challenge, and decided to pursue a challenge involving JS. Lo and behold the tip calculator challenge! It isn't complete - I need to revisit it but most of the functionality is here.

## Notes to myself
Currently the design is responsive ( please DO NOT LOOK AT MY CSS :) ) but missing form validation and basic tweaks for user experience.

# Ch4 CSS - QR code component 

Instead of following the assignment in the course I deviated and wanted to try something different. I found a really interesting site dedicated to learning front-end, and really cool beginner project using html + css. This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). It's not an exact spec (and that's ok with me) all the bits are there and I think it's pretty cool :D

## My process

### Built with

- HTML markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This was the first time I've ever written any CSS (eeek!) and at first it felt super overwhelming. My goal was simple: get my page to resemble the design (mostly hehe). I tried to follow the box model, and experimented with padding and margin to position elements on the page. It was super fun, and I think frontend mentor is a great resource for learning!

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools CSS!](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - Found myself here a lot! The explanations and tutorials were super helpful :)
